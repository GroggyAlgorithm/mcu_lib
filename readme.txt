
Folder for library files for microcontrollers. View documentation or source/header files for any requirements. 
Basic requirement is for all is a "config.h" file to be included in this directory. This is where any important macros
and such should be defined (such as BAUD, F_CPU/XTAL,...).



Do not edit, change, merge, clone, push, or anything else directly to main OR dev. When editing, please clone from dev and 
allow me to review before anything is done to dev.
